Hi! I'm a cartographer and developer working for the [LAMPEA](https://lampea.cnrs.fr) laboratory at [MMSH](https://mmsh.fr) in Aix-en-Provence (Fr), where I develop tools and workflows for the open science in archaeology. I also teach cartography for [Master's students in urbanism](https://master-urbanisme.www.univ-montp3.fr/fr/%C3%A9quipe/equipe-et-fonctionnement-p%C3%A9dagogique) at Paul-Valéry University in Montpellier. I am the [creator](https://mapper.fr/carnet/introducing-mapstodon/) of [mapstodon.space](https://mapstodon.space), a Mastodon instance dedicated to cartography and geospatial that gathers about a thousand carto geeks (and growing!). 

Generally speaking, I like to implement creative approaches to answer complex questions at the crossroads of science and society, with a focus on the spatial dimension and using open source tools and open data. I'm occasionnaly open to work [in cartography and open data processing](https://mapper.fr/en/blog/social-position-index/). [Feel free to reach out](https://mapper.fr/en/#contact)!
