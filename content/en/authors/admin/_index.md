I'm a geographer and developer working at [LAMPEA](https://lampea.cnrs.fr) lab in Aix-en-Provence, France, on the deployment of [ArcaDIIS](https://arcadiis.science), an Archaeological Data Infrastructure for Interoperability and Sharing. I've been working previously as a freelance mapmaker and geographer, as a project manager at [LPED](https://lped.fr) for the [MC3 international research network](http://mc3.lped.fr) and as a research engineer at [SATT Sud-Est](https://sattse.com/) where, with a team of urban planners and climatologists, I conceived and built the [MACLI pedagogical model](https://gomet.net/environnement-macli-un-kit-pedagogique-pour-comprendre-les-microclimats-urbains/) for the simulation of the urban heat island.
