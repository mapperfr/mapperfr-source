I'm a developer for the open science in archaeology at the [LAMPEA](https://lampea.cnrs.fr) laboratory ([MMSH](https://mmsh.fr), Aix-en-Provence, France), and a teacher in cartography for [Master's students in urbanism](https://master-urbanisme.www.univ-montp3.fr/fr/%C3%A9quipe/equipe-et-fonctionnement-p%C3%A9dagogique) at Paul-Valéry University in Montpellier. I also [founded](https://mapper.fr/carnet/introducing-mapstodon/) [mapstodon.space](https://mapstodon.space), a multilingual Mastodon instance dedicated to cartography and geospatial that gathers about a thousand members (and growing!). I'm open to work [in cartography and open data processing](https://mapper.fr/en/blog/social-position-index/) - [feel free to reach out](https://mapper.fr/en/#contact)!
