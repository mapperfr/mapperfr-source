Hi! I'm a geographer, mapmaker and developer currently working for the [LAMPEA](https://lampea.cnrs.fr) laboratory at [MMSH](https://mmsh.fr) in Aix-en-Provence (Fr). I'm also an assistant Professor in cartography at Paul-Valéry University in Montpellier. I've been working previously as a freelance mapmaker and geographer, as a project manager at [LPED](https://lped.fr) for the [MC3 international research network](https://mc3.lped.fr) and as a research engineer at [SATT Sud-Est](https://sattse.com/) where, with a team of urban planners and climatologists, I helped to design and build a [pedagogical model](https://gomet.net/environnement-macli-un-kit-pedagogique-pour-comprendre-les-microclimats-urbains/) simulating the urban heat island.
